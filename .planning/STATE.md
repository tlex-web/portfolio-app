## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Bugs and stability first (Phases 1-2), then visual identity (Phases 3-5)
- [Roadmap]: Design tokens before components -- Phase 3 must complete before Phase 4
- [01-02]: AVIF quality 50 comparable to JPEG 82 due to superior compression
- [01-02]: New suffix naming (-sm/-md/-lg) avoids collision with old variants
- [01-02]: Old variant files left in place; cleanup deferred to future phase
- [Phase 01]: HighlightValue defined in data/types.ts to avoid circular deps between data and component layers
- [Phase 01]: Conditional rendering pattern over dynamic Component variable to maintain type safety

### Pending Todos

- Clean up old image variants (-thumb/-medium/-large) after component references are updated

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
